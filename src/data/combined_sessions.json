    "Description": "Don't be intimidated. Modern AI can feel like magic, but underneath the hood are principles that web developers can understand, even if you don't have a machine learning background. In this workshop, we'll explore a complete GPT-2 inference implementation built entirely in Vanilla JS. This JavaScript translation of the popular \"Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need\" approach will let you debug and step through a real LLM line by line without the overhead of learning a new language, framework, or even IDE.\r\n\r\nAll the major LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Llama, inherit from GPT-2's architecture, making this exploration a solid foundation to understand modern AI systems and comprehend the latest research.\r\n\r\nWhile we won't have time to cover *everything*, you'll gain the essential knowledge to understand the key concepts that matter when building with LLMs, including how they:\r\n\r\n-Convert raw text into meaningful tokens\r\n- Represent semantic meaning through vector embeddings\r\n- Train neural networks through gradient descent\r\n- Generate text with sampling algorithms like top-k, top-p, and temperature\r\n\r\nThis intense but beginner-friendly workshop is designed specifically for web developers diving into ML and AI for the first time. It\u2019s your \"missing AI degree\" in just two hours. You'll walk away with an intuitive mental model of how Transformers work that you can apply immediately to your own LLM-powered projects.",

We\u2019ll end with various examples of how these scoring models are being deployed across the whole stack from online control flows for agents, to reward models for algorithms like RL, to rankers for inference time scaling methods like ensemble generation.\r\n",

This approach delivers superior performance by enabling specialized agents to collaborate across layers\u2014outperforming today\u2019s frontier models in both accuracy and efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo ground this new paradigm in its roots, we\u2019ll also explore how Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures continue to push the boundaries of scale and specialization. Learn how Cerebras trains state-of-the-art MoEs from Daria Soboleva, Head Research Scientist.",
